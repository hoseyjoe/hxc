# A case is `--- name [@lib] [@module=pack.Mod] [@dump=items] [@gencs] [@serial] [@stress-fieldlookup]
# [@stress-arrayforward] [@runtimeconfig] [@netlib[=Name[,Name...]]] [@run-timeout=seconds] [@optimized]
# [+ extra hxc args]`, its source, `===`,
# and the expected result. The source goes in the module's file; a source line `//// <path>` starts
# another file, at <path> relative to the case directory (not in a @gencs case, whose source gencs gets
# as one file). Each case compiles twice into a fresh directory, and its .dll must be
# byte-identical between the two, pass ILVerify, run (unless @lib) and dump as expected. A second
# compile that exits differently from the first is reported as "second compile failed (exit N)", not as
# nondeterminism; on a real mismatch both copies are kept in $HXC_TEST_TMP/nondeterministic/<case>/{a,b}.
# A case with `-debug` among its extra args also writes a .pdb, and its second compile is made in
# another folder: every source file the case wrote is copied to <case>/m/ (same relative paths) and
# hxc runs there with --cwd <case>/m, writing m/b/P, so the .dll and .pdb must be the same wherever the
# sources are. That .pdb must also hold neither the case directory's path nor the user's profile folder
# (written with / or \, as an MSYS or a Windows path, in any case), as `grep -a -i -F` finds it in the
# file or in the Document names HxcCheck's docs prints (a name is stored part by part, so the file alone
# never shows it whole), or the case fails with `the PDB holds a machine path: <path>`.
# A @stress-fieldlookup case's .dll must also pass HxcCheck's stress-fieldlookup (haxe.lang.FieldLookup
# called from many threads at once), and a @stress-arrayforward case's HxcCheck's stress-arrayforward
# (its P.toInts making the first cast of one array from many threads at once). A @runtimeconfig case
# is not run; its <name>.runtimeconfig.json is the result instead, so a case can build for a .NET
# version this machine does not have. An @optimized case's program (hxc's build) runs with
# DOTNET_TieredCompilation=0: the fully optimized JIT from the first call, as a stack trace from a
# long-running program sees it.
# ILVerify's report fails a case, unless the expectation has a [verify] section holding exactly that report.
# A @gencs case is also compiled by Haxe 4.3.7's gencs (-D no-compilation, built for net10.0 with
# gencs.csproj.in); a run whose output differs from the hxc run adds a [gencs] section to the result,
# and a case whose expectation has no [run] section takes the gencs output as that expectation.
# @gencs compares runs, so it cannot go with @lib or @runtimeconfig (nor can @serial). A @gencs case
# is expected to compile: unless its expectation has a [compile] section, hxc failing or writing no
# .dll fails the case.
# A @netlib case gets fixture .NET libraries, the projects in tests/dotnet/netlib/<Name>/. A bare @netlib
# passes ValLib, and @netlib=Name[,Name...] passes the named ones (CarLib, EvLib, LibA, LibB, M4Lib, ModLib, ValLib), as
# `--net-lib <dir>/<Name>.dll` to both hxc compiles and to gencs's haxe command, and as a <Reference> in
# the csproj gencs's output is built with. Only the named libraries are passed, but every fixture .dll is
# copied beside hxc's output (after the determinism check) and beside gencs's, so a library that is
# referenced and not passed is found as a user's would be (LibA references LibB). The fixtures are built
# once per run into $HXC_TEST_TMP/netlib-<hash> (dotnet build -c Release -o), where the hash covers their
# sources and the .NET SDK version, so a directory already there is reused and a changed fixture gets a
# new one. That hash is part of the gencs cache key of every @netlib case.
# A @serial case is a @gencs case whose program takes `gen <file>` and `rt <in> <file>`: gen writes
# `name<TAB>serialized` lines to <file> and prints them, rt unserializes each line of <in>, serializes
# it again, writes the lines to <file> and prints them. Both builds run gen (the [run] comparison
# above); gencs's rt of its own file is the reference, shown under [rt]. hxc's rt of gencs's file,
# gencs's rt of hxc's file and hxc's rt of its own file must print the same, or the result gets an
# [rt hxc<-gencs], [rt gencs<-hxc] or [rt hxc<-hxc] section. With no [rt] in the expectation,
# gencs's is the expectation, as for [run]. A gencs gen that prints nothing or writes an empty file
# fails the case, since every comparison would then pass with nothing in it.
# Every run of a test program (hxc's or gencs's build) stops after $HXC_RUN_TIMEOUT seconds, 120 by
# default, or after @run-timeout's seconds for that case; its output then ends with
# `[timeout after Ns]` (a gencs run that times out fails the case), and the other cases go on.
# Compiles and builds have no such limit.
# Case directories go under $HXC_TEST_TMP, by default tests/dotnet/tmp (gitignored), so one
# antivirus exclusion covers the assemblies they write.
# Cases run -j at a time (default $HXC_TEST_JOBS, or 8), each in its own directory. Their reports
# print in case order as they become available, and the totals add up each case's own result. The
# cases whose results depend on timing, @stress-* and @run-timeout ones, run alone after the rest, so
# the reports from the first of them on wait for that. -j 1 runs every case in order, one at a time,
# as the script always did. gencs's builds run -j at a time too (the timing-dependent cases' alone,
# after the rest), and gencs generates C# at least 6 at a time. If $HXC_TEST_TIMES names a file, each
# case appends `<seconds> <name>` to it.
# gencs's results for a case are cached in $HXC_TEST_TMP/gencs-cache: its run's output or its
# problem, and for a @serial case also its rt output, gen.txt and its build, which hxc's builds read
# and run. The key covers the case (name, tags, extra args, source and run time limit),
# gencs.csproj.in, this script's gencs steps, the Haxe version, path and std files, the global hxcs
# (haxelib's path for it, its haxelib.json, git HEAD and files), the .NET SDK version and the time
# zone (and, for a @netlib case, the fixtures' hash), so only a case whose gencs results could differ
# goes through gencs again. Problems from gencs's build or a timed-out run are not cached, and nothing
# is when the Haxe version is wrong.
# --no-gencs-cache neither reads nor writes the cache; entries unused for 30 days are removed.
# Bash's forks are slow on Windows, so the steps for each case avoid subshells where they can.
